# Interface: CropYear

[v4-specification](../modules/v4_specification.md).CropYear

Crop management details grouped by a planting year.

**`example`** For crop management practices in 2000:

```js
{
 "plantingYear": 2000,
 "crops": [
   // ... crops that were planted in year 2000
 ],
}
```

## Properties

### crops

• **crops**: [(AnnualCrop \| CoverCrop \| OrchardOrVineyardCrop \| PerennialCrop)?, (AnnualCrop \| CoverCrop \| OrchardOrVineyardCrop \| PerennialCrop)?, (AnnualCrop \| CoverCrop \| OrchardOrVineyardCrop \| PerennialCrop)?]

A list of crops for a given planting year.

Due to a limitation at COMET farm, the maximum number of crops per [plantingYear](#plantingYear) is 3. If there are more than 3 crops for a planting year reach out to [Nori support](mailto:support@nori.com)

**`maxitems`** 3

**`example`** When 3 crops (an annual, perennial and orchard) were planted in year 2000:

```js
"crops": [
 {
   "type": "corn",
   "classification": "annual crop",
   // ...CropEvents
 },
 {
   "type": "annual rye",
   "classification": "perennial",
   // ...CropEvents
 },
 {
   "classification": "orchard",
   // ...CropEvents
 }
]
```

### plantingYear

• **plantingYear**: `number`

The planting year that the herein defined [crops](#crops) property is associated with. Note that a requirement to run quantification is that all crop management practices be mapped to a particular planting year as early as year 2000.

**`minimum`** 2000

**`maximum`** 2099

**`example`** When the herein defined crops were planted in year 2000:

```js
