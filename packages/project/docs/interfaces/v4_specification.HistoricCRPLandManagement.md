### preYear1980

• **preYear1980**: ``"upland non-irrigated"`` \| ``"irrigation"`` \| ``"lowland non-irrigated"`` \| ``"livestock grazing"``

A description of how the land was managed before 1980.

**`example`** When the land was not upland (referring to any land that is not low or marsh-like) irrigated before 1980:

```js
"preYear1980": "upland non-irrigated"
```

**`example`** When the land was irrigated before 1980:

```js
"preYear1980": "irrigation"
```

```js
"preYear1980": "lowland non-irrigated"
```

**`example`** When the land employed livestock grazing before 1980:

```js
"preYear1980": "lowland non-irrigated"
